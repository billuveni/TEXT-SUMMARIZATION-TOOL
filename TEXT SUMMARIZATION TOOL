Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans. 
It plays a critical role in sectors like healthcare, automotive, finance, and more. AI can be categorized into narrow AI and general AI. 
Narrow AI is focused on a single task, while general AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can. 
The development of AI brings both opportunities and challenges, such as ethical concerns, job displacement, and security risks.
